So far this semester, some of the things you have learned include;

- The difference between a text document and a binary document.
- How to work with the git version control system, as well as utilize a remote repository.
- 2 markup languages
    - markdown

This week we will start learning about and exploring CSS or **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets.

CSS is a language that tells browsers how to display and style content in HTML. It will not change the content itself, but will allow you to specify color, font, size, background, padding, alignment, how pages resize, if certain elements should be hidden, and many more qualities.
