# Opacity

In addition to setting the color of background elements and text, we developers may dictate the opacity of elements themselves of just the background-color of an element.

Opacity is set as a ration between 0.0 - 1.0. This controls how much, if at all, elements behind the element in question may be seen. A value of 0.0 would make the element in question invisible, and 1.0, make it totally opaque.

There are two ways to dictate opacity.


### Background Opacity

In order to change the opacity of the background-color only, you can pass `rgba()` (as opposed to `rgb()`).

Like, `rgb()`, `rgba()`, takes three numbers to define the ratios of red, green, & blue. However, `rgba()` also take a fourth number, in the range of 0.0-1.0, to define the opacity level.

<div id="code-heading">CSS</div>

```css
* {
    rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```

### Element Opacity

If the goal is to change the opacity of an entire element, as well as its contents, then you can call the separate `opacity: ` property. Like the fourth argument for `rgba()`, this property takes a single number, between 0.0-1.0, to represent the opacity of an element.


<div id="code-heading">CSS</div>

```css
div.inner-container {
    opacity: 0.5;
}
```

## Example

The following Example creates 4 elements.

1. `.body-1` is the furthest back, and has no opacity values set.
2. `.box-1-inner` is nested within box one. The color is set to green, and CSS specifies the `opacity: ` property be set to 0.5. Notice how both the color of the box, as well as the white text, are effected by the red of `box-1`.
3. `box-2` is a separate element, which has been positioned to overlap the other two boxes. Notice that it uses the `rgba()` property, which allows the background color to allow bleed through, but _NOT_ the text.
4. `image-box` is just a flat, black, logo of a buff. It uses the `opacity: ` property, and as such, allows the other three boxes to bleed through it.
