# HTML
This week we are going to start using HTML or the HyperText Markup Language. 

HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages. HTML was first proposed in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee, then a contract physicist at CERN. 

To learn a little more about the history of HTML, you should read the [“History” section from the associated Wikipedia page][1] & [Amy Hisson’s “History of HTML and CSS”][2].
