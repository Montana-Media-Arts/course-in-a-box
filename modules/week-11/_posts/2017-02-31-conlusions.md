# Weekly Conclusions

This week you explored revisited images in webpages, and also looked at how images are being used within two trending design patterns.

You were also asked to read a number of articles about the web design and development process.

Using the information from this week you will be asked to complete one final assignment, while also beginning work on your final website.

There is a link to information about the final website project above in the navigation bar. ([Or click me!](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/mart341-webDev/modules/final-info/overview/)).

There is a HW assignment, as usual, in the HW Wiki portion of the [class GitHub repository](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/341-work/wiki/Week-11-HW). This will be your last homework assignment apart from the final project.
