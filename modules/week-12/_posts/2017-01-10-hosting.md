# Hosting

Throughout this semester, we have utilized ["GitHub pages"](https://pages.github.com) as our hosting service and website server. GitHub pages has been perfect for us, as they allow for free hosting of static sites* up to 2GB in size.

*_A static site is one that does not require backend server processing. A static site is a collection of html, css, and javascript files, which are all pre-made, stored on a server, and served "as is" to the requesting client._

There are, of course, many other options for hosting websites, all with various positives and drawbacks. Some more popular companies include;

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Google Web Hosting
- Bluehost.com

These are in addition to the option of self-hosting a web server.

To learn more about various hosting options, as well as how to utilize these services, including the use of File Transfer Protocol (FTP) applications, please read;
