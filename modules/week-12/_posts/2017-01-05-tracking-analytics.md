# Tracking Analytics

Tracking Analytics are web tools, that allow services like Google to "track" activity on your websites, so that you can understand information about your visitors. This information may include;

- Number of visitors
- What sites/pages they are spending time on
- Where they came from (google, bing, etc.)
- What links they are clicking in your site
- etc.

The most prominent tool for analytics tracking is provided by [Google](https://analytics.google.com/).

For an in depth explanation of using tracking analytics, please read;

- Read pgs 483-486 in chapter 19 of the Duckett.
- Please also read ["The Absolute Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Google Analytics" - Moz](https://moz.com/blog/absolute-beginners-guide-to-google-analytics)

## Final Project Consideration

If your final project site is one you intend on maintaining for some time beyond this course, please consider integrating a Google Analytics Tracking ID into it now!
