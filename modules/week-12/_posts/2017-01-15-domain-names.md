# Domain Names

Another, obviously important, detail in web development is that of registering and using a domain name.

As a review, a [domain name](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-domain-name-2483189) is a human-readable string, such as `michaelmusick.com`, `whitehouse.gov`, or `umt.edu`. This is part of a the larger, and complete URL, such as `https://www.whitehouse.gov/`. This URL is registered with Domain Name Server (DNS), which will reroute the request with the IP address of the physical server where a sites data is located.

We use domain names instead of IP addresses, because they are easier to remember for humans. This fact is why it is critical you pick a "good" domain name. Please read the following article, which has some practical tips for choosing a domain name;

## Register a Domain Name

You will likely need to go through a third-party company to identify, register, and manage your domain names. Some of these include;

- [Google Domains](https://domains.google/)
- [Go Daddy](https://www.godaddy.com)
- [AWS Route 53](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar.html)

## Route a Domain

Depending on the way in which you are hosting a site, you will next need to direct your domain name to point to the IP address of the server where your website is hosted. Each hosting company will give explicit instructions for how to do this.

If you choose to self-host a server, that is, setup a web server in your home or business, then you will need to use a service like "DynDNS", which handles connecting the dynamic IP addresses that IPS providers supply to home networks. Please read the following for more information on that process;
