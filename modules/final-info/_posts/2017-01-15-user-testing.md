# User Testing

As your site starts to take shape, throughout every stage of development, you should engage in user testing and feedback collection. This will let you know whether you being successful in your work.

In the early stages, such as when you are developing what your site is about, and the content of your site, you might simply ask people for their responses to your ideas, or writing.

As you develop wireframe, show them to friends, whose aesthetic judgment you trust. (Or setup virtual sessions with class colleagues to help each other out.)

As you start coding the site, send out working prototype to friends or colleagues. Ask them things like;

- Is the content presented logically?
- How does this site look on your "x-device"?
- Can you read everything?
- Do the links work for you? Or did you find any dead links?
- What are your general impressions of this site?

You are expected to discuss this process in your final readme.md report. As well as how the user testing/feedback fed back into changes of your site.
