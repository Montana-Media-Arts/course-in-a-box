# GitHub Repository Details

You are to create a new GitHub repository for this final project site. This way, all of your code and resources in this repository will only be for the final project site.


<br />


You can do one of two things;

1. Create a new GitHub repo, named whatever you want. The URL for your final site would then be `http://your-user-name.github.io/final-site-name/`
2. Or, you can create a repo called `your-user-name.github.io`, in which case your site will be available at the base level of your GitHub URL (i.e. `http://your-user-name.github.io`).

In either case, your main `index.html` document, should be at the top level of your new GitHub repository directory.

You will need to review how to create a GitHub Repo from the course content.
