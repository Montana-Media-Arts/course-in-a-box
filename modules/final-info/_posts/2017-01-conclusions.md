# Conclusions

Depending on the amount of time you spent practicing your skills this semester, this final project will likely take you between 10 and 30 hours of work. Give yourself plenty of time for this entire process. It is not possible to complete in a couple days.

## Submissions Details

As with all homework assignments, you will submit your final project as two links to a "final-project" wiki page. This will be added closer to the deadline.

For this assignment, you will submit;

- a link to the live, final site
- a link to your `readme.md` report

Your readme should be more substantial than a normal homework readme, as you need to discuss your entire process for this project, as well as how this relates to your work this semester. Remember to rely and include the documentation you have been collecting throughout the final project. As a final section in this document, you should also include what you think you future and next steps in web development will be beyond this course.

Good luck with the final, ask for help, and give yourself plenty of time to work/play.
