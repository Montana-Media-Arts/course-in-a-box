# Images
Images, unlike hyperlinks, use the URL source to retrieve additional data for the page, as opposed to sending the user to another page. 

As I am _sure_ you can imagine, you will need use images a lot in web design and development. 

## The Image Tag

As with the break (`<br />`) and horizontal ruler (`<hr />`) elements, the image element is an empty element that only requires a single tag. This tag is `<img />`. 

As with hyperlinks, this element is reliant on attributes within the tag to allow it to be useful. 

#### Source (`src=""`)

The first attribute that we will need to consider is “`src=""`”. Within the double quotes you will need to include an URL to the location of the desired image. This will typically be a relative URL to a file stored on the same server as the web page, but can also be an absolute URL to an image anywhere on the Internet. 

#### Alt Text (`alt=""`)

Proper style and accessibility standards dictate that you should always include the alt text attribute. The key for this is simply “`alt=""`”. The value in the double quotes should describe the image. This description is used by screen readers for those who are visually impaired. Therefore it is critical that you provide a detailed description, especially in the case where the image is necessary to understand the content of the page. 

#### Title (`title=""`)

As with the Alt Text attribute, you should also get in the habit of always including a title attribute. Most browsers will display this text as a tooltip, when a user hovers their mouse over am image with the included attribute. 

The alt and/or title attributes will also be used by some browsers in the case where the image itself cannot load.
